## Business Prospect

•	This project helps users find their favorite lodging during travel, based on image similarity

•	It would provide value to:

 o	People who are looking for stylish, funky, fancy airbnb apartment(s) for their travel
 
 o	Apartment owners who want to know how many apartments in the same city looks like theirs so that they can make their apartments either look unique or close to the apartments already popular. 

## Data sources

•	InsideAirbnb, a dataset published by Airbnb which includes info of all apartments in the U.S. (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)

•	Images and info of Airbnb apartments in Boston were scraped by urllib2


## Data Preparation

•	*Online collection*

  o Basic info of Airbnb apartments (location, descriptions, price range, webpage URL) were retrieved from *InsideAirbnb* and saved to MongoDB running on AWS

```  
Airbnb_web_scrape_script.py :
Read urls from airbnb apartment list file(Downloaded from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html), scrape desired apts infos and save to json files
 ``` 

o	Apartment images were scraped from Airbnb and saved to MongoDB
```
Airbnb_Image_scrape_script.py:
Read json files generated by the step above, fetch apt images and save them locally
```
   
o	Highlight tags and user reviews were scraped meanwhile and saved for potential use in the future

•	*Offline processing*

 o	For each apartment image, Image features were extracted and saved to csv file (with its ID) 

```

Gist_feature_extraction_script.py:
Extract gist features from images, save to a pickle file locally along with meta data

HSV_feature_extraction_script.py:
Extract HSV features from images, save to a pickle file locally along with meta data

Feature_combination_script.py: 
Merge the above two features into one single feature, save to a picke file locally along with meta data
```

  o	Put highlight and reviews to csv file for further uses
  
## Modeling

•	*Similarities calculation*
  
  o	Cosine Distance
  
  o	Pearson correlation


  
•	*Image feature extraction*
  
  o	HSV-Histgram
  
  o	GIST

  o CNN(to do)
  
  o	others(to do)

## Evaluation - conceptually and quantitatively

 • *Model Validation*：Image features and similarity measurements were tested on a subset of Indoor Scene Recognition dataset from MIT. For more details: http://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/indoor.html

Examples in the dataset:

Florist:
<img src="https://github.com/starfoe/Eye-bnb/blob/master/iconImage/Picture2.png"> </img>
Dining room：
<img src="https://github.com/starfoe/Eye-bnb/blob/master/iconImage/Picture3.png"> </img>

•  *Assumption*: features of images in the same category(bedroom/bookstore/florist/dining room..) should be closer to each other than that from different categories. Quantitatively speaking, the higher the ratio of dis(within clusters)/dis(between clusters) , the better the feature is.
  `Calinski_harabaz` was used to quantitatively validate the features. For comparation, a baseline case was fabricated by shuffling the image labels to make them random. The performance was as follows:



  Calinski_harabaz for the real case is 22.816
  Calinski_harabaz for the random case is 0.986
  
  It's clear that Calinski_harabaz for the real case is quite higher than that of the baseline case, indicating that the feature works for representing images

•	*Visualization*: look at returned results and conceptually feel if they make sense

## Deployment

•	Step1: given a picture, the system can return places look similar to it (of the same style)

•	(backlog) Step2: users can add some word descriptions to specify where they dream of going ( industrial style, splendid..) to refine the result


## Results:


Given the image on the upper left, the following apartments are recommended:
<img src="https://github.com/starfoe/Eye-bnb/blob/master/iconImage/true_case.png"></img>

With the same picture, the following apartments are regarded as dissimilar:
